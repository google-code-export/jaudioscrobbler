#Alpha version expectatives

=== JAudioScrobbler is now in Aplha version ===

We started this project in January 17th 2010 and now it is in alpha version which means it is ready for the final user, but it is still a work in progress, we know there are still some bugs, and new features ready to show up.

If you can send us feedback and issues report we will thank you, since is the right way to improve this application.

ALL the best.
